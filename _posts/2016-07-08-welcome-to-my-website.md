Well it wouldn't be a proper welcome without a code snippet would it...?!?!

Below is some Ruby code that returns true if 3 is between 1 and 5 inclusive otherwise false.

```
Beast@Destiny~ $ irb
irb(main):001:0> (1..5) === 3
=> true
irb(main):002:0> (1..5) === 7
=> false
irb(main):003:0> exit
Beast@Destiny~ $
```

You can read up more on [Interactive Ruby shell](
http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html) or irb [here](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell)

If you have Ruby installed you can run:

```
man irb
```
